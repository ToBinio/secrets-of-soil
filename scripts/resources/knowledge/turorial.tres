description = "The village needs food. Fast.
If I don’t help, they’ll starve.

First step: pick some seeds and plant them where the soil feels right.
Plants grow better if they like the spot — somewhere damp, near the well maybe.

I should check that book — it’s got some facts on each type.
Could help me figure out what grows best where.
Some villagers might share extra info too… if I bring them the right plants.

Alright, get planting. Keep them happy. Watch them grow."
